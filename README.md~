Indexing
========

A cross-platform, command-line desktop search application. It is able to search within gzip and bzip2 archives.

At present indexing is done manually, by using index -i followed by a directory.

The command to search the index is "index" followed by keywords.

An overview of the components of this project:

* Indexing.hs - the main indexing and searching code.
* Unpacks.hs - a module that does unpacking of archive files for searching. Also does conversion to plain text.
* FileCons.hs - the low-level file access code used by Indexing.hs. Also stands on its own as a library.
* The driveletters project - a Windows program called driveletters.exe is used to generate the letters of fixed drives on the system. This component is built by Visual Studio 6.
